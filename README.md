Features
- ERC-20 compliant token
- Built on Polygon Amoy testnet
- Hardhat for compilation, deployment, and testing
- MetaMask wallet integration
- Ready for future dApp development

Tech Stack
- Blockchain: Polygon (Amoy testnet)
- Smart Contract Framework: Hardhat
- Wallet Integration: MetaMask
- Token Standard: ERC-20


Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repo
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/adel-token-contract.git
  cd adel-token-contract

3. Install dependencies
  npm install

4. Compile smart contracts
  npx hardhat compile

6. Deploy to Polygon Amoy
   Make sure you have a .env file with your PRIVATE_KEY and RPC_URL for Polygon Amoy.
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network amoy


Usage
Import the deployed contract address into MetaMask as a custom token.
